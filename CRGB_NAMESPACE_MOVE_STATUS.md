# CRGB Namespace Move Status

## What was accomplished:

1. **Created `src/fl/crgb.h`** - A new header file containing CRGB in the `fl` namespace
   - Basic CRGB struct with core functionality (constructors, operators, accessors)
   - Minimal dependencies to avoid circular dependency issues
   - Proper namespace encapsulation

2. **Updated `src/crgb.h`** - Converted to a stub header that:
   - Includes the new `fl/crgb.h`
   - Provides `using fl::CRGB;` declaration for backward compatibility

3. **Updated forward declarations** in the following files:
   - `src/fx/video.h`
   - `src/hsv2rgb.h`
   - `src/fl/file_system.h`
   - `src/fl/raster_sparse.h`
   - `src/fl/str.h`
   - `src/fl/tile2x2.h`

## Current status:

The basic namespace move structure is in place, but there are namespace resolution issues preventing compilation. The main problem is that the `fl` namespace has complex interdependencies that create circular references when including certain headers.

## Issues encountered:

1. **Circular dependencies**: Including FastLED headers like `math8.h` pulls in the entire FastLED ecosystem, creating circular dependencies.

2. **Namespace nesting issues**: The compiler is looking for `fl::fl::string` instead of `fl::string`, indicating namespace resolution problems.

3. **Missing function implementations**: The current minimal CRGB lacks many functions from the original (like saturating arithmetic operators that depend on `qadd8`, `qsub8`, etc.).

## What needs to be completed:

1. **Resolve namespace issues**: Fix the `fl::fl::` namespace resolution problems throughout the codebase.

2. **Add missing CRGB functionality**: 
   - Saturating arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.)
   - HSV conversion support
   - Color constants (HTMLColorCode enum)
   - All the member functions from the original CRGB

3. **Handle dependencies carefully**: Find a way to include necessary math functions without pulling in problematic headers.

4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure all tests pass and the namespace move doesn't break existing functionality.

## Recommended next steps:

1. **Fix namespace resolution**: Investigate and fix the `fl::fl::` namespace issues
2. **Incremental approach**: Add CRGB functionality piece by piece, testing after each addition
3. **Dependency management**: Create lightweight versions of needed math functions or find alternative approaches
4. **Comprehensive testing**: Run the full test suite after each major change

## Files modified:
- `src/fl/crgb.h` (created)
- `src/crgb.h` (converted to stub)
- `src/fx/video.h` (forward declarations)
- `src/hsv2rgb.h` (forward declarations)
- `src/fl/file_system.h` (forward declarations)
- `src/fl/raster_sparse.h` (forward declarations)
- `src/fl/str.h` (forward declarations)
- `src/fl/tile2x2.h` (forward declarations)

The foundation for the namespace move is in place, but additional work is needed to resolve the dependency and namespace issues.
