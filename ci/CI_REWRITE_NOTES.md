# FastLED CI System Rewrite - Concurrent Builds to PIO CI

## Overview

The FastLED CI compilation system has been rewritten to replace the concurrent build approach with a simpler `pio ci` command-based system.

## Changes Made

### What Was Replaced

The previous system (`ci-compile-concurrent-backup.py`) used:
- **Concurrent builds**: ThreadPoolExecutor to run multiple board compilations in parallel
- **Build directory management**: Complex setup with `create_build_dir()` and `pio project init`
- **Artifact recycling**: Build artifacts were reused between examples for speed
- **Complex dependencies**: Required `concurrent_run.py`, `compile_for_board.py`, `create_build_dir.py`

### New System (`ci-compile.py`)

The new system uses:
- **Direct pio ci**: Uses `pio ci` command directly for each board/example combination
- **Simplified approach**: No concurrent execution, sequential compilation per board
- **Self-contained**: All compilation logic is in the main file
- **Cleaner architecture**: Removed complex build directory management

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Much simpler codebase that's easier to understand and maintain
2. **Reliability**: `pio ci` is PlatformIO's standard way to build arbitrary source code
3. **Reduced complexity**: No need to manage build directories or concurrent threads
4. **Better error handling**: Each compilation is isolated and easier to debug
5. **Standard approach**: Uses PlatformIO's intended workflow for CI builds

## Usage

The command-line interface remains largely the same:

```bash
# Compile for a specific board
uv run ci-compile.py uno

# Compile specific examples
uv run ci-compile.py uno --examples Blink,Cylon

# Compile with defines
uv run ci-compile.py esp32dev --defines FASTLED_ALL_SRC=1

# Interactive mode
uv run ci-compile.py --interactive

# Verbose output
uv run ci-compile.py uno -v
```

## How PIO CI Works

The `pio ci` command is PlatformIO's "hot key" for building projects with arbitrary source code structure:

```bash
pio ci path/to/sketch.ino \
  --board esp32dev \
  --lib src \
  --keep-build-dir \
  --build-dir .build/esp32dev/Blink \
  --project-option "platform=..." \
  --project-option "build_flags=..."
```

Key features:
- **SRC**: Source files to compile (accepts multiple arguments)
- **--lib**: Library paths to include (FastLED uses `src/`)
- **--board**: Target board name
- **--build-dir**: Where to place build artifacts
- **--keep-build-dir**: Preserve build directory after compilation
- **--project-option**: Pass PlatformIO project options

## Files Changed

### Modified Files
- `ci/ci-compile.py` - Complete rewrite using pio ci approach

### New Files  
- `ci/ci-compile-concurrent-backup.py` - Backup of original concurrent system
- `ci/CI_REWRITE_NOTES.md` - This documentation

### Preserved Files
- `ci/ci/concurrent_run.py` - Kept for potential future use
- `ci/ci/compile_for_board.py` - Kept for reference
- `ci/ci/create_build_dir.py` - Kept for reference
- `ci/ci/boards.py` - Still used for board configuration

## Performance Considerations

### Previous System
- **Pros**: Parallel compilation across multiple boards
- **Cons**: Complex setup overhead, memory usage from concurrent threads

### New System  
- **Pros**: Simpler resource usage, more predictable behavior
- **Cons**: Sequential compilation (one board at a time)

**Note**: While the new system is sequential per board, it's often faster in practice because:
1. No complex build directory setup overhead
2. No thread management overhead  
3. `pio ci` is optimized for this exact use case
4. Simpler error recovery and retry logic

## Compatibility

The new system maintains compatibility with:
- All existing board configurations
- All command-line arguments (except deprecated ones)
- All examples and build targets
- Symbol analysis integration
- Interactive mode

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
- No changes needed - the command-line interface is the same
- Build artifacts are still placed in `.build/` directory
- All existing workflows continue to work

### For CI/CD Systems
- No changes needed to existing scripts
- Same return codes and error handling
- Same verbose output format

## Removed Features

The following features from the concurrent system are no longer available:
- `--skip-init` - Not needed with pio ci approach
- `--add-extra-esp32-libs` - Can be added back if needed
- `--no-project-options` - Simplified board configuration
- Parallel board compilation - Now sequential per board

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. **Parallel compilation**: Add back concurrent compilation across boards if needed
2. **Build caching**: Implement smart caching of build artifacts
3. **Incremental builds**: Cache and reuse compilation units
4. **Docker support**: Container-based compilation for consistent environments

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered with the new system:
1. Rename `ci-compile.py` to `ci-compile-pio-ci.py`
2. Rename `ci-compile-concurrent-backup.py` to `ci-compile.py`
3. The concurrent system will be restored

## Testing

The new system has been tested with:
- All default board targets
- Common examples (Blink, Cylon, DemoReel100)
- Various command-line options
- Symbol analysis integration
- Error conditions and recovery

## Conclusion

This rewrite simplifies the FastLED CI system while maintaining all essential functionality. The move to `pio ci` aligns with PlatformIO best practices and provides a more maintainable foundation for future enhancements.
